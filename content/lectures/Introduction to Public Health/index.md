summary: "A national rabies elimination program is a coordinated effort by a government or organization to eliminate the transmission of rabies within a specific geographic area. The program typically involves a combination of measures, including vaccination of domestic animals, such as dogs and cats, as well as wild animals, such as foxes and raccoons, where appropriate. "
