summary: "A national rabies elimination program is a coordinated effort by a government or organization to eliminate the transmission of rabies within a specific geographic area. The program typically involves a combination of measures, including post exposure prophylaxis for animal bite, vaccination of domestic animals, such as dogs and cats, as well as wild animals, such as foxes and raccoons, where appropriate.

---

Rabies is a viral disease, present on all continents, except Antarctica. Rabies causes tens of thousands of deaths every year, mainly in Asia and Africa. Human cases of rabies are reported from India, all over the country with the exception of Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. Dogs are the main source of human rabies, up to 99% of all rabies transmissions to humans occur after dog bites. Rabies is 100 percent fatal but preventable.

National Rabies Control Programme was approved during 12th Five Year plan to control the rabies in the country as a Central Sector Scheme under the umbrella of National Health Mission (NHM) by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.

**National Action Plan for Dog Mediated Rabies Elimination from India by 2030:**

It is a multi-pronged strategy based on One Health Approach. The concept of One Health recognizes that the health of people is closely related with the health of animals, plants and their shared environment. In One Health approach multiple sectors communicate and work together at the local, regional, national, and global levels with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes.

**Vision**: To achieve zero human deaths due to dog-mediated Rabies by 2030.

**Mission**: To progressively reduce and ultimately eliminate human rabies in India through sustained, mass dog vaccination and appropriate post-exposure treatment.
