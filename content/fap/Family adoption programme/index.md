### Family Adoption Programme(FAP)

The Family Adoption Programme (FAP) is designed to give medical graduates in India a **hands-on learning experience** in community-based healthcare and promote equity in health. FAP is part of the Community Medicine subject curriculum and is recommended to start in the first year of medical school, with increasing competencies throughout the entire MBBS training program.

The adoption should focus on villages that are not covered by PHCs/RHTCs adopted by the medical college. Students will be divided into teams and each team will visit five families per student. Students were briefed on the objectives and competencies of FAP, followed by hands-on practice and a visit to three nearby villages for their first adoption visit. During the visit, students interacted with families, documented details, and presented their findings in a PowerPoint presentation, reflecting on their experience. Mentors provided feedback to refine the document.
