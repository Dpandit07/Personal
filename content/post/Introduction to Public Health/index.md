### 18th Century: 

**1760-1840:** In the 18th century, with the beginning of industrial revolution there was  booming of opportunities and development. People migrated to cities from rural areas resulted in overcrowding. In addition to that, poor workers were often housed in cramped, grossly inadequate quarters. Working conditions were difficult and exposed employees to many risks and dangers, including cramped work areas with poor ventilation, trauma from machinery, toxic exposures to heavy metals, dust, and solvents. All those problems grabbed the attention of people and Government on the urgent need to improve health conditions for the population. That led the foundation of public health and government seriously started to think about public health. 

### 19th Century: 

**1846:** It was the third Cholera pandemic which was originated in India in the 19th century (1846-1860) that reached far beyond the border. More than one million people died of cholera. The epidemic in London claimed over 10,000 lives, and there were 23,000 deaths for all of Great Britain. This pandemic was considered to have the highest fatalities of the 19th-century epidemics. A British physician **John Snow**, who was working in a poor area of London, identified contaminated water as the means of transmission of the disease.  He had mapped the cases of cholera in the **Soho area in London** and found out the mode of transmission of disease. He introduced the methods of investigations for public health field, hence, is considered as  ***"Father of Modern Epidemiology"*** & cholera is often considered as ***Father of Public Health***. 

**1848:** With the finding of the role of polluted water in transmission of cholera, filth and garbage were recognised as man’s greatest enemies and it lead to great sanitary awakening bringing **Public Health Act** of **1848** in England, in acceptance of the principle that the state is responsible for the health of the people. It was one of the great milestones in public health history,*“the beginning of a commitment to proactive, rather than a reactive, public health”*. For the first time, the state became the guarantor of standards of health and environmental quality and provided resources to local units of government to make the necessary changes to achieve those standards.

**1856:** In 1856, **William Buddd** another pioneer by careful observations of outbreak of **Typhoid Fever** concluded that the spread was by drinking water. In addition to suggesting that typhoid fever was water-borne, Budd also argued that the mode of transmission was feco-oral. He suggested that poor hygiene and unsanitary living conditions contributed to its spread and recommended improved sanitary measures to slow and prevent transmission, including the sanitization of patients’ clothes, the use of disinfectants such as carbolic acid, and the boiling of water. Finding the role of contaminated water in transmission of Cholera and Typhoid, there occurred the demand of clean water among public. 

**1875:** A comprehensive piece of legislation was brought into force in England in 1875, known as the **"Public Health Act-1875"** for the control of the men's physical environment. It was a significant step in advancement of public health. The Act also meant that every public health authority had to have a medical officer and a sanitary inspector, to ensure the laws on food, housing, water and hygiene were carried out; and that towns had to have pavements and street lighting.

***The early phase of the public health (1880-1920) is often called the disease control phase. Efforts were directed entirely towards general cleanness, garbage and refuse disposal.  Quarantine conventions was held to control the diseases.***

### 20th Century: 

**1948:** When diplomats met to form the United Nations in 1945, one of the things they discussed was setting up a global health organization.WHO’s Constitution came into force on 7 April 1948 – a date we now celebrate every year as World Health Day. The first Health Assembly opened in Geneva on 24 June 1948 with delegations from 53 of the 55 Member States. It decided that the Interim Commission was to cease to exist at midnight on 31 August 1948, to be immediately succeeded by WHO.


**1968:** Barefoot doctors  were healthcare providers who underwent basic medical training and worked in rural villages in China. They included farmers, folk healers, rural healthcare providers, and recent middle or secondary school graduates who received minimal basic medical and paramedical education. They promoted basic hygiene, preventive healthcare, and family planning and treated common illnesses. The concept of  barefoot doctors inspired the 1978 World Health Organization conference on primary health care and the resulting Alma Ata Declaration.

**1978:** Declaration of Alma-Ata was adopted at the International Conference on Primary Health Care (PHC), Almaty (formerly Alma-Ata), Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (present day Kazakhstan), 6–12 September 1978. It expressed the need for urgent action by all governments, all health and development workers, and the world community to protect and promote the health of all people. It was the first international declaration underlining the importance of primary health care. The primary health care approach has since then been accepted by member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) as the key to achieving the goal of "Health For All", but only in developing countries at first.

### 21st Century: 

**2000:** The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) – which range from halving extreme poverty rates to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and providing universal primary education, all by the target date of 2015 – form a blueprint agreed to by all the world’s countries and all the world’s leading development institutions. They have galvanized unprecedented efforts to meet the needs of the world’s poorest.

**2015:** The  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set up in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and are intended to be achieved by the year 2030. They are included in a UN Resolution called the 2030 Agenda or what is colloquially known as Agenda 2030. These are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all". Each goal typically has 8–12 targets, and each target has between 1 and 4 indicators used to measure progress toward reaching the targets. The targets are either "outcome" targets (circumstances to be attained) or "means of implementation" targets
